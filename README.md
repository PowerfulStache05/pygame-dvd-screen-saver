# pygame-dvd-screen-saver
A classic DVD screen saver I recreated with pygame

Just open screen saver.py on your IDE of choice and run the program to watch that little logo bounce around the window. Do you think it'll ever reach a corner?
Make sure the DVD logo image is in the same file as the py file

I tried to make the icon change colors but I couldn't do it
